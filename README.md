## Project Overview
I built a static web application to present my analysis of an HVAC service call recording. The application displays call transcript analysis, compliance scoring across 6 stages, and sales insights

## Solution Approach
* Technology Stack: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* Scored each stage from 0-100 based on presence, quality and completeness.
* The overall compliance score is the average of scores across all stages.
* Clean design with interactive elements to show and hide transcript and hover to display highlighted notes.

## Tools used
- **Assembly AI** for speech-to-text transcriptions.
- **Perplexity AI** for creating the website, initial analysis and proofreading.
